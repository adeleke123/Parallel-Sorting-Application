## Project Description:

The project aims to build a parallel sorting application that sorts a large dataset using multithreaded quicksort in C++. The user should be able to specify the size of the dataset and the number of threads to use for sorting. The application should be able to run on a multi-core processor and take advantage of the available resources for faster sorting.

## Project Requirements:

+ Develop a multithreaded quicksort algorithm in C++ for sorting the dataset.
+ Implement the algorithm using the C++ threading library for creating and managing threads.
+ Allow the user to specify the size of the dataset and the number of threads to use for sorting.
+ Measure the performance of the sorting algorithm in terms of time taken to sort the dataset.
+ Display the sorted dataset to the user.
+ Implement error handling to prevent crashes in the application.

## Project Steps:

+ Develop the multithreaded quicksort algorithm in C++.
+ Use the C++ threading library to create and manage threads for sorting the dataset.
+ Implement user input to specify the size of the dataset and the number of threads to use for sorting.
+ Implement performance measurement of the sorting algorithm.
+ Display the sorted dataset to the user.
+ Implement error handling to prevent crashes in the application.
